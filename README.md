## Github static file publishing

zola publish -o branch/docs

branch in the digikata workspace is setup to point to the `published` branch
  https://github.com/digikata/digikata.github.io

That repo is setup to serve github static pages from `published/docs`.
It doesn't use the root default `/` config because that would wipe out a local
git config for pushing published pages.

## Changes

2025-12-09 update to zola 0.21.0, change theme, change blog impl
