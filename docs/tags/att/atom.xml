        <content type="html" xml:base="https://digikata.com/2009-02-att-u-verse-vs/">&lt;p&gt;About a year ago ATT started rolling out U-Verse in my neighborhood. Since then, every quarter or so, I get an ATT marketing visitor to my door trying to sell me the service which is, at its full glory,  a combined phone-internet-cable service. (and I think, is fiber-optic to some sort of neighborhood box, but not to your house). Today was the latest visit, but the first marketer was the worst, they didn&#x27;t know any details about the service except is fiber-optic and really great. They didn&#x27;t know what channels they deliver, they didn&#x27;t know the up and down speeds of the net connection, they didn&#x27;t know the price of the accounts after the &quot;promotional period&quot; was over. Somehow they were trained to expect such exitement over the phrase &quot;fiber-optic&quot; that they could instantly sell the new U-Verse service. Oh, that and combined billing. I really really don&#x27;t care about combined billing. I care about what I actually get for my money.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, things have improved a little. At least the reps know the very basic details of whats offered, like what is the actual speed of the network link that I get. Still when the ATT rep shows up at my door again, and we talk about the detals beyond &quot;its fiber-optic and it&#x27;s great&quot;, I find again and again that for the services that I care about - all three categories are more expensive then my current services. Maybe I&#x27;m just an uber-consumer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think the fundamental problem is that ATT doesn&#x27;t understand that I&#x27;m a telecom Luddite. My landline service is basic with no additional phone services like caller ID, etc. My cell phone is pay-as-you-go.  Between the barebones local-only ATT account and my third-party long distance company, my family and I make basically unlimited calls for a combined 20-35 a month.  The ATT price would be $30&#x2F;mo. I only very occasionally break $30 a month so really ATT loses here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My net connection is a third-party DSL provider at $20&#x2F;mo for 3Mbps down and 768kbs up. ATT&#x27;s rep today claimed 3Mbps  down and 1 Mbps up (their website claims  512bps up) for $30&#x2F;month, or for $20&#x2F;month I can get 768&#x2F;384 kbps. Either again the shiny fiber-optic almost-to-the-home service loses again. The ironic thing here is that ATT supplies the underlying DSL connection here either way, but can&#x27;t seem to keep from offering pathetic value for internet connections.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&#x27;m also a cable Luddite. Dish Network charges about $35&#x2F;mo for local channels and a number of basic cable channels. It&#x27;s pointless comparing the actual number of channels between a given ATT and Dish plan because it would inevitably end up with a race bewteen who offers more QVC or Jewelry TV shopping channels. ATT&#x27;s U-Verse service starts at $54 a month. My family already watches as much programming as they have time for, and with a Netflix account, we what whatever piques our interest. Maybe that makes my family post-telecom consumers or something like that. I value the Netflix service more than I value a higher tier cable service, but if I added that cost in, ATT would come in at $4&#x2F;mo higher.  Still U-Verses loses again to the tune of $4 to $20 a month.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, U-Verse offers no reason to pay more per month for about the same service. Maybe U-Verse offers some value to people paying for more premium services that I care to get, but until ATT offers some better value to this customer --  well, I guess I&#x27;ll see them in three months.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
