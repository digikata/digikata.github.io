Reasonably basic use of EC at this level of description, but it is always nice to see a review of various design decisons in a real world system.\nAbstract, comments and links further on.\n\nAbstract The storage group of CERN IT operates more than 20 individualEOS storage services with a raw data storage volume of more than 340 PB.Storage space is a major cost factor in HEP computing and the planned futureLHC Run 3 and 4 increase storage space demands by at least an order of mag-nitude.A cost effective storage model providing durability is Erasure Coding (EC). The decommissioning of CERNâ€™s remote computer center (Wigner/Budapest) allows a reconsideration of the currently configured dual-replica strategy where EOS provides one replica in each computer center. EOS allows one to configure EC on a per file bases and exposes four differentredundancy levels with single, dual, triple and fourfold parity to select differentquality of service and variable costs.This paper will highlight tests which have been performed to migrate files ona production instance from dual-replica to various EC profiles. It will discuss performance and operational impact, and highlight various policy scenarios toselect the best file layout with respect to IO patterns, file age and file size.We will conclude with the current status and future optimizations, an evaluationof cost savings and discuss an erasure encoded EOS setup as a possible tapestorage replacement\nAlso included some discussion of conversion and anticipated performance due to\nthe EC storage design decisions.\nConference link\nDirect paper link\n","id":"https://www.digikata.com/erasure-coding-cern/","title":"Paper: Erasure Coding for production in the EOS Open Storage system"},"https://www.digikata.com/links-testing-distributed-sys/":{"body":"A nice resource on testing distributed systems including approaches and public real world instances of projects tested.\nOn github ~astarain/testing-distributed-systems\n","id":"https://www.digikata.com/links-testing-distributed-sys/","title":"Resource: Testing Distributed Systems"},"https://www.digikata.com/rust-io-uring-part1/":{"body":"There are really a lot of different io_uring crates for rust. Some are quick\nbindings, some are specialized to particular application or runtime\nenvironments, some are doing deeper experiments to how they connect to the\napplications using the interface,  I think I'll start looking at them to\ncontrast their approaches in a little more detail.\n\nFirst a little background on a number of different approaches a program can\ntake in order to make I/O calls, be they to the network, disk, or some other\ndevice. This post is the first in a series of notes reviewing the tradeoffs of\nthe various approaches at a high level, from different kinds of synchronous\ni/o calls to different kinds of asynchronous calls. Some focus on an\nenvironment where a program os running directly in an OS, but a lot of this\nalso applies in other environments besides Rust.\nThe first part is below on a little background on Synchronous I/O and\narchitectures that handle it, mostly a language independent discussion.\nSynchronous I/O\nSynchronous I/O is the most common way to access data where program execution\nwaits on calls to read or write data. It is supported by common system I/O\napis (POSIX et al), and is simple, robust, and easy to reason about.\nCalling a synchronous I/O call blocks further execution within a single\nprocess or thread, which is why these system calls are often referred to as\nblocking calls or a blocking api. If the needs of the program are only to get\none operation done at a time this is not a big concern. But the blocking makes\nthe use synchronous methods limited in the top throughput of progress that can\nbe made from multiple operations or I/Os that can be made within a program at\nonce. This can limit the responsiveness of a program to singular operations,\nin addition to increasing latency of response to operations that may be\nwaiting.\nThe operating system doesn't stop when these calls are made, if there are\nother processes or threads, an OS scheduler can decide to make another process\nactive to get work done while waiting on the I/O of the blocked process to be\ncompleted. In older computer architectures, the balance of time waiting for one\nblocking I/O call was a very reasonable optimization as the time of response of the \nunderlying resouse, disk or network for example, could be used to switch through \nmultipe contexts to run other processes.\nBut an application doesn't have to be stuck with only one blocked i/o \ncall. And applications that care about higher throughput on dedicated systems\nmay want an application to use more system resources.\nConcurrent I/O Methods\nThere are ways to do more work in a computer system, and a program can arrange\nits architecture a different way to open more processes or threads with\nsynchronous calls. For example, one can do this by spawning a thread for every\noperation that is anticipated to make a blocking call. \nThis does incur some overhead: eg on creation of thread/process specific stack\nmemory regions, as well as the introduction of a need for some level of memory\nsharing locks/mutexes or messaging mechanisms so that the different threads\ncan coordinate; more on that later. But the basic idea here is if the\napplication wants to keep processing multiple operations, a thread can be\ncreated for each operation and if it blocks on a particular call, progress for\nthe application overall can still be made over a number of threads. In this\narchitecture, the system api calls are the same synchronous i/o calls as\npreviously mentioned. \nThe advantage here is that the fairly simple i/o access interactions are\npreserved with the addition of the need for management of shared data\nstructures. Typically the change isn't too different, as a separation of data\nfor the overall application vs data for specific operations is one that can be\ncleanly layered.\nA common pattern with this approach is to pre-spawn threads into a pool. From\nthe pool threads are available to map new operations to open threads and\notherwise queue ops to wait for a free thread. The pool gives a couple of\nadvantages such as trading thread creation times for lower thread mapping\ntimes, in addition, it can create a natural point of control for the number of\noutstanding threads. The ability to limit the number of threads creates is\nsometimes important for controlling resource growth, robustness, and system\noptimization as the creation and context switching costs can increase with a\nlarge number of threads.\nThis optimization touches on some of the drawbacks of using a set of threads\nto form concurrency. Ironically within the OS, the internals of i/o access are\ngenerally implemented using asynchronous apis, with a support layer to receive\nuserspace synchronous syscalls for i/o, which queues and manage those\noperations mapping to a more fundamental internal asynchronous i/o layer.\nEnter Asynchronous I/O APIs\nBeyond thread pools, another level of system performance for i/o involves use\nof asynchronous apis to access network and disk i/o. Note this is a different topic\nthan the async/await Rust language support, it is what apis an OS offers up to applications\nto interact with their kernels and i/o subsystems. The access apis become less\nstandardized:\n\nWindows\n\nI/O Completion Ports\n\n\nBSD-Family / MacOS\n\nposix aio\nkqueue\n\n\nLinux\n\nposix aio\nlinux aio\nio_uring\n\n\n\nThe next part (if I ever find some time) will focus in on the Linux asynchronous apis and in particular io_uring and Rust crates accessing that interface.\n","id":"https://www.digikata.com/rust-io-uring-part1/","title":"Rust and io_uring Part 1"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.digikata.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://www.digikata.com/article-modern-storage-devices/":{"body":25,"title":7},"https://www.digikata.com/blog-reboot/":{"body":79,"title":2},"https://www.digikata.com/erasure-coding-cern/":{"body":181,"title":8},"https://www.digikata.com/links-testing-distributed-sys/":{"body":17,"title":4},"https://www.digikata.com/rust-io-uring-part1/":{"body":521,"title":4}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
