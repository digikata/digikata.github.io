[New Scientist](http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn14593-wind-turbines-make-bat-lungs-explode.html?feedId=online-news_rss20) writes on a report of wind turbines killing bats, two species in particular accounting for 60% of winged animal deaths.  The bats lungs are apparently being damaged by the low-pressure region surrounding wind turbine blades.

Though one could trade off the cost-benefit of bat deaths vs general power generation pollution deaths, maybe we need to install ultra-sonic whistles on turbine blades.  About 4,000 to 18,000 Hz might [work](http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/mammals/housebat/batrep.htm). (and [here](http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/naturalresources/DD1141.html)).
