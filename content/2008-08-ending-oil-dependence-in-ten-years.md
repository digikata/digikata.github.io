I'll probably be trying to examine both Obama's and McCain's technology policies a little more closely, but for today, just a little note:

Last night, at the Democratic National Convention, Barack Obama's [acceptance speech](http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/samgrahamfelsen/gG5l5C) mentioned that he would set a goal to "in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East." The technologies Barak cited in the speech were numerous, but the first one mentioned was natural gas. Now most of our oil goes to transportation energy so could he have had [natural gas vehicles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_vehicle) in mind?
