Nature is beautiful. #9 is one of my favorites. Once you're through with looking at the sun imagery, look at some of the other [Big Picture](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/) columns. Who says that newspapers can't figure out the web. The [Boston Globe](http://www.boston.com/) seems to be doing well in the medium in this case.
