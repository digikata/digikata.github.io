Not that it would ever happen, but I think that if the taxpayers are bailing out the Big 3 automakers, we should basically require them to be broken up into smaller independent companies.  Down the line, if they waste the opportunity (ahem Chrysler), then at that point, they should be small enough to fail and would be replaced by healthier, more responsive companies that can restart from a fresh perspective -- like [Aptera](http://www.aptera.com/) or [Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/) or [Wrightspeed](http://www.wrightspeed.com/) (and those are just the exciting ones there are more boring competitors...).
