Hmm, cleaning out my bookmarks, I opened up the NBC Olympics site. At the height of the 2008 Olympics they had been running Microsoft's [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/) pretty heavily all over the place. Today, because I run [NoScript](http://noscript.net/) on Firefox, I see a big pre-loading box saying - download Adobe flash 7 or higher all over the place. The videos still seem to use silverlight though... Ah I'm probably just remembering wrong.
