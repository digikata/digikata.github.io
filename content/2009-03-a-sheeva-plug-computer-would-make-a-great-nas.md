I've been looking at the [Sheeva Plug dev kit](http://www.marvell.com/products/embedded_processors/developer/kirkwood/sheevaplug.jsp) from Marvell. It seems to be an ARM core System-on-Chip (SoC), Linux compatible, with an interesting combo of device controllers hanging off of it, including ethernet, USB, and SATA ports.

The dev kit seems to be the size of a large wall wart and part of Marvell's "Plug Computing" marketing drive. Not sure about plug computing bit, but I'd love to fit the board into a small two or three bay external drive enclosure, or maybe a drive [dock](http://www.geeks.com/details.asp?invtid=EN391&cat=CSE).  Running a minimal linux system, a looks like it would be a nice way to setup a local Network Attached Storage (NAS) backup system with enough smarts to do offsite backups to [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) or Rackspace's [Mosso](http://www.mosso.com/cloudfiles.jsp).
