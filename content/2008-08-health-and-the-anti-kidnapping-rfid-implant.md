A Gizmodo [article](http://gizmodo.com/5040538/mexicos-rich-embedding-gps+assisted-rfid-tags-under-their-skin-in-case-of-kidnapping) describes Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags being implanted into people as an anti-kidnapping measure by a company called Xega in Mexico. The system reportedly involves an external GPS unit keeping in contact with the RFID tag. Besides the problem of getting separated from the external GPS, there may be some health implications too. I don't know if Xega uses the same packaging/RF technologies a VeriChip, but there were studies linking RFID to "induced" tumors in mice, as described in this Salon [article](http://machinist.salon.com/blog/2007/09/10/rfid_cancer/). Hmm, protection against kidnapping now, or possible cancer later - decsions, decisions...

Coverage on the RFID tags also on Slashdot [here](http://idle.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/08/22/1928238).
