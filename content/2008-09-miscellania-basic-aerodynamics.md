For anyone with curious kids (or is a curious kid) who want to know more about how airplanes fly, NASA has posted some material in an [index](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/short.html) of informations meant for K-12 education. My favorite part is the FoilSim Java applet with controls and displays to illustrate what is going on with various parameters with a 2D airfoil.
