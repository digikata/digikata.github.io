This has to be one of the coolest UAV uses I've come across in a while - delivery of medical samples or critical supplies like snake anti-venom between remote locations and labs. New Scientist quotes TB researcher Ruth McNerney Ruth McNerney of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the UK, "It's a very exciting idea. We need to know if it's reliable enough from a technological point of view, but we will only find out by trying." - an attitude which is far too short a supply in the world.



Of course this predates the truly important use of UAVs - who's willing to try UAV pizza delivery with me!
