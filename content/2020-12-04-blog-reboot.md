Time to reboot my blog. The old [site](http://digikata.blogspot.com) is still
served by Blogger but, I will probably shift the content to this main site at
some point.

This site is generated by the [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static site
generator written in rust. Hosted on github static pages. See below the fold 
for misc details.

Still making some cleanup adjustments.

Edited: shifted the DNS records for https://www.digikata.com to the new static
stite from the old host. HTTPS access will get setup as soon at the
certificate gets issued.

Github pages can host custom domains, but scripted push updates seem to unset
the custom domain configuration. Added a CNAME file with the domain into the
served branch and directory to fix that (see [issue
link](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages/issues/236) for more background
info.)
