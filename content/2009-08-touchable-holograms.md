Popular Science posted this [article](http://www.popsci.com/entertainment-amp-gaming/article/2009-08/tokyo-scientists-create-touchable-hologram) and video about touchable holograms at [Siggraph](http://www.siggraph.org/) '09, this year. It's a combination of three items: a 3d display using concave mirrors something like this [3D mirascope toy](http://www.amazon.com/Toysmith-79747-Mini-3-D-Mirascope/dp/B000N5T8KA), two wii-motes strapped statically for position detection, and a home-brewed (university-brewed?) [phased array](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array) of ultrasound drivers.
